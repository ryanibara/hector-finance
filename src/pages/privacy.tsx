    </p>

    <h2>What legal grounds do we rely on?</h2>
    <p>
      Your personal information as described above is processed by us on a basis
      of the following legal grounds:
    </p>
    <Level2>
      Taking steps prior to entering into a contract and necessity for
      performance of a contract with you – We may need to collect and use your
      personal information in order to enter into a contract with you or to
      perform a contract that you have with us, for example, when you provide
      personal information to us in order to purchase our tokens, if necessary
      for such purchase.
    </Level2>
    <Level3>
      In such a case, the provision of your data is necessary in order to enter
      into a contract and also a contractual requirement as without such data we
      are not able to enter into a contract with you.
    </Level3>
    <Level2>
      Compliance with legal obligations – We may process your personal
      information as may be required by respective legal or regulatory
      obligations that may apply to us.
    </Level2>
    <Level3>
      In this case, the provision of your data is a statutory requirement
      without which we are not able to comply with our legal obligations.
    </Level3>
    <Level2>
      Our legitimate interests – We may use your personal information for our
      legitimate interests to improve our Services, thus maintain and develop
      our business activities as well as to protect and enforce our or third
      party’s rights, if necessary.
    </Level2>
    <Level3>
      Please be informed that you have the right at any time to object to the
      processing of your personal information which is based on our or third
      party’s legitimate interest.
    </Level3>
    <Level2>
      Your consent – We send to you direct marketing e-mails upon your previous
      consent. Each such e-mail also contains a link that allows you to opt-out
      from receiving such e-mails, update your contact information or change
      your preferences at any time.
    </Level2>
    <Level3>
      To withdraw any consent to processing your personal information, please
      use our electronic form or by clicking on a link provided in every e-mail
      sent to you to unsubscribe from such marketing electronic communication.
    </Level3>

    <h2>How may we share the information we collect?</h2>
    <p>We may disclose information: </p>
    <ul className="ml-4 list-inside list-disc">
      <li>
        to our current or future affiliated companies, their respective parent
        companies, subsidiaries or joint ventures, if sharing the data with them
        is necessary to fulfil the purpose of the data processing. These
        companies may process such data as a processor on our behalf and we will
        ensure that such activities are subject to contractual obligations on
        privacy, security and other matters in accordance with this Privacy
        Notice;
      </li>
      <li>
        to our partners and third-party service providers that perform certain
        services to use on our behalf (for example, marketing companies,
        web-hosting companies, analytics providers and information technology
        providers). In these circumstances contractual and other technical and
        security safeguards will be put in place with the partner or service
        provider, including to ensure that your personal information is
        processed only in accordance with this Privacy Notice;
      </li>
      <li>
        to law enforcement, other government authorities, or third parties
        (within or outside the jurisdiction in which you reside) as may be
        permitted or required by the laws of any jurisdiction that may apply to
        us. In these circumstances, we will take reasonable efforts to notify
        you before we disclose your information, unless prior notice is
        prohibited by applicable law or is not possible or reasonable in the
        circumstances;
      </li>
      <li>
        to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or
        other third parties in connection with the completion of a transaction
        in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell,
        liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets. Upon completion
        of such a transaction, your personal information will continue to be
        processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice, except as otherwise
        agreed by you or permitted by applicable law;
      </li>
      <li>
        to partners, financial institutions or service providers who may request
        such information in connection with providing services to us, including
        banking services, and only where we enter into an agreement with such
        institutions to limit their use and handling of personal information in
        accordance with this Privacy Notice.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Important note: We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share personal
      information that reasonably identifies you or your organisation with
      unaffiliated entities for their independent use except as expressly
      described in this Privacy Notice or with your prior separate consent. We
      may share information that does not reasonably identify you or your
      organisation as permitted by applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you voluntarily make your personal information available online in
      our environment shared by third parties (for example, on messaging
      applications, social media, message boards, web logs, or emails), that
      personal information may be viewed, saved, collected, heard, used and/or
      shared by third parties outside of Hector Finance. We are not responsible
      for any unauthorised third party using such information. Please be mindful
      whenever you share any information in such environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Site may include integrated content or links to third parties’ content
      (for example, social media content, plug-ins and applications, video
      materials, etc.) which are governed by the third parties’ privacy settings
      and policies, which may differ from this Privacy Notice. This Privacy
      Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for or able to
      control, the privacy, security, or other practices of such third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
    <p>
      We deploy organisational, technical and physical safeguards designed to
      protect the information that we collect. This includes, when required or
      appropriate and feasible, obtaining written assurances from third parties
      that may access your personal information that they will protect the
      information with safeguards designed to provide a level of protection
      equivalent to that adopted by Hector Finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may store the information we collect on our servers both cloud-based or
      in servers located in countries where we or our service providers have
      facilities. Therefore, we may transfer information to countries outside of
      your country of residence which may include countries outside the EU
      member states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if you are the EU citizen and provide us with your
      personal information, it may then be transferred for the purposes stated
      herein to third countries outside the EU/EEA under conditions set in this
      Privacy Notice and you consent to this by using our Site or Services.
    </p>

    <h2>What are your rights?</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting
      the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
      Therefore, the marketing e-mails we send to you include the opt-out link
      for you to unsubscribe from receiving such communication (as well as
      update your contact information). We will honour your choice and without
      delay refrain from sending you such e-mails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under local law, you may have certain rights regarding processing of your
      personal information, in particular, you have the right to request: (i)
      access to your personal information, (ii) rectification or erasure of your
      personal information, (iii) restriction of processing concerning you, (iv)
      objection to processing that is based upon our legitimate interests (as
      already stated above), and (v) data portability to other service
      providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any
      complaint or concern about your privacy. If, however, you believe that we
      have not been able to assist with your complaint or concern, you may have
      the right to lodge a complaint with a respective supervisory data
      protection authority, as applicable, in your jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to contact us, please use the methods stated above.</p>
    <p>
      Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors
      and, in some instances, we will not be able to comply with your request,
      for example because we have legitimate grounds for not doing so or where
      the right doesn’t apply to the particular information we hold on you.
      Where so entitled to access to your personal information, you will not
      have to pay a fee unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
      excessive (upon which we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply
      with your request). If you would like to discuss or exercise the rights
      you may have, you can contact us through the methods stated above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please keep us informed if your personal information changes whilst we
      continue to retain such information. We encourage you to contact us to
      update or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that
      any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate or out of
      date.
    </p>

    <h2>Final provisions</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time and we encourage you
      to periodically review this Privacy Notice. If we make any material
      changes to this Privacy Notice regarding the way we collect, use, and/or
      share the personal information that you have provided, we will notify you
      by posting notice of the changes on the Site or, if we hold your email
      address, by email.
    </p>

      personal information, which supplement, and should be reviewed alongside,
      this Privacy Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Notice, terms used have the same
      meaning as in the Terms and Conditions.
